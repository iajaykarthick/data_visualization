Three ways to get insights from data:
* Calculating summary statistics
  * mean, median (measure of quantity / measure of center of the data)
  * standard deviation (measure of variation)
* Running models:
  * Linear Regression,  Logistic Regression (to model relationship between the variables)
* Drawing plots
  * Scatter, bar, and histogram
