## Types of Variables

- Continuous Variables
    - Usually numbers, (the things that we can do arithmetic on)
    - Examples: heights, temperatures, revenues
- Categorical Variables
    - Usually Text, (the things that can be classified)
    - Examples: Eye colors, countries, industry
- Can be either (depends on the given problem)
    - age is continuous, but age group is categorical
    - time is continuous, but month of year is categorical
    - In such cases, we have the freedom to treat them as either continuous or categorical depending on the question that we try to answer.
