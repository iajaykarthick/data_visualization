# Bar Plot

> A close relative of box plots
> 

Most common use cases:

- You have a categorical variable
- You want counts or percentage for each category.

Occasionally:

- You want another numeric score for each category and need to include zero in the plot.

As bar plot must always begin at zero, logarithmic scale is not possible(logarithm of zero is $- \infty$.
