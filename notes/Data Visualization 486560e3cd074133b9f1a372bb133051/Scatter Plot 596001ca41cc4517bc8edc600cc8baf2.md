# Scatter Plot

- Visualizing and analyzing the relationship between two variables is essential in data analysis.
- For instance, a scatter plot can be used to show the relationship between price and area.
- However, it can be difficult to read when the data is not scaled properly. Using a logarithmic scale on both axes can help improve readability, as shown in the example below.

When interpreting scatter plots, it's important to understand the concept of correlation. Correlation measures how well we can fit a straight line through the data points.

The image below shows a strong positive correlation as indicated by a line that slopes upwards and to the right. This indicates that as one variable increases, so does the other. In contrast, a strong negative correlation is shown by a line that slopes downwards and to the right, indicating that as one variable increases, the other decreases.

The middle images shows there is no correlation at all between x and y. The values of y are completely unrelated to the values of x.

Correlation is a statistical measure that quantifies the strength of the relationship between two variables. It is used to determine whether there is a linear relationship between x and y, and it can indicate the degree of association between them. However, it's important to note that correlation does not imply causation. While correlation can be a useful way to analyze data, it can be misleading if the relationship between the variables is more complex. In such cases, other statistical methods such as regression analysis may be necessary to gain a better understanding of the nature of the relationship.

When adding a straight line to a scatter plot, it is possible to identify a linear relationship between x and y. However, if the relationship is more complex, a straight line may not be the best fit. This is particularly evident in the price versus area plot when using a linear scale, as the line completely misses the more expensive homes. In such cases, a curve may be a better alternative, as it can capture the non-linear relationship between the variables. In the image below, the curve shows that as the area increases, the price increases faster than linearly. This can be useful information for those looking to understand the housing market and make informed decisions about buying or selling property.
