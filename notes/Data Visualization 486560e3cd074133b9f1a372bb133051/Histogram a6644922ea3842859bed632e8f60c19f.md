# Histogram

> Approximate representation of the distribution of the numerical data. The term was first introduced by [Karl Pearson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Pearson)

It is a chart that plots the distribution of the continuous variable’s values as a series of bars.

Each bars typically covers a range of numeric values as a bin or class

Bar’s height indicates the frequency of data points within the corresponding bin.

- Takes one continuous variable as its input.
- It allows us to answer questions about the shape of the variable’s distribution.

Compared to other summarizing methods, histograms have the **richest descriptive power** while being the fastest way to **interpret data** – the human brain prefers visual perception.

However, if you are not careful, viewers **will not be able to understand** your histogram, or you may fail to get the most out of it. It is especially important to **specify the optimal bin size**.

Wikipedia has an [extensive section on rules of thumb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram#Number_of_bins_and_width) for choosing an appropriate number of bins and their sizes, but ultimately, it’s worth using domain knowledge along with a fair amount of playing around with different options to know what will work best for your purposes.

Using the histogram, we can see 

- where the peaks of the distributions are.
- whether the distribution is skewed or symmetric.
- whether there are any outliers.
