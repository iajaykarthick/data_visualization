# Line Plot

When should we use a line plot ?

- two continuous variables
- want to answer questions about their relationship?
- Consecutive observations are connected somehow.

Use case of line plot is same as the scatter plot but with one extra condition.

> Consecutive data points are connected in someway.
> 

The most common case is that the x-axis represents the dates or times.

Another useful thing about line plot is that we can draw multiple lines on the same plot and compare them.

Another useful thing is to compare the line plots to a trend line generated from a linear regression.

Line plots are excellent for comparing two continuous variables, where consecutive observations are connected somehow. A common type of line plot is to have dates or times on the x-axis, and a numeric quantity on the y-axis. In this case, "consecutive observations" means values on successive dates, like today and tomorrow. By drawing multiple lines on the same plot, you can compare values.

The following line plot shows the percentage of households in the United States that adopted each of four technologies (automobiles, refrigerators, stoves, and vacuums) from 1930 to 1970.

If you have a dataset where the values span several orders of magnitude, it can be easier to view them on a logarithmic scale.

A subset of the COVID-19 coronavirus data is shown in the line plot. Here, the six countries with the most number of confirmed cases outside of mainland China are shown.

On the **linear** scale, notice that moving up one grid line in the plot **adds** 20000. On the **logarithmic** scale, moving up one grid line in the plot **multiplies** by 4.
