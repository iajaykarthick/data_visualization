# Box Plot

**Issue with individual histogram**

- Individual Histograms are great, but there is a problem if we want to draw lots of them.

**Naive Solution - I**

- Draw the same histogram but use different colors for each class.
- This is Not easily interpretable.

**Naive Solution - II**

- Draw each histogram in its own panel
- Not easy to compare distributions across each categories

### Solution - Box plot

Box plots split a continuous variable, by a categorical variable.

Allows us to compare distributions in space efficient way.

When to use? 

1. When you have a continuous variable, split by a categorical variable
2. When you want to compare the distributions of the continuous variable for each category.

**The lower quartile**, or first quartile (Q1), is the value under which 25% of data points are found when they are arranged in increasing order. 

**The upper quartile**, or third quartile (Q3), is the value under which 75% of data points are found when arranged in increasing order.

The **interquartile range(IQR)** is the difference between upper and lower quartiles. 

The **semi-interquartile range** is half the interquartile range.
