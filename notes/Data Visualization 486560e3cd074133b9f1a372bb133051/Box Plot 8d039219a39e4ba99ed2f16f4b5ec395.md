# Box Plot

**Issue with individual histogram**

- Individual Histograms are great, but there is a problem if we want to draw lots of them.

**Naive Solution - I**

- Draw the same histogram but use different colors for each class.
- This is Not easily interpretable.

**Naive Solution - II**

- Draw each histogram in its own panel
- Not easy to compare distributions across each categories

### Solution - Box plot

Box plots split a continuous variable, by a categorical variable.

Allows us to compare distributions in space efficient way.

When to use? 

1. When you have a continuous variable, split by a categorical variable
2. When you want to compare the distributions of the continuous variable for each category.

**The lower quartile**, or first quartile (Q1), is the value under which 25% of data points are found when they are arranged in increasing order. 

**The upper quartile**, or third quartile (Q3), is the value under which 75% of data points are found when arranged in increasing order.

The **interquartile range(IQR)** is the difference between upper and lower quartiles. 

The **semi-interquartile range** is half the interquartile range.

The horizontal lines, known as **WHISKERS, each bar extends** from the minimum to the lower quartile (the start of the box) and then from the upper quartile (the end of the box) to the maximum.

A variation of the box and whisker plot restricts the length of the whiskers to a maximum of 1.5 times the interquartile range. 

That is, the whisker reaches the value that is the furthest from the centre while still being inside a distance of 1.5 times the interquartile range from the lower or upper quartile. 

Data points that are outside this interval are represented as points on the graph and considered potential outliers.

Power of box plot is to compare distributions across multiple categories.

For Denmark, we have an outlier at 53.
