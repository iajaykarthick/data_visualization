# Dot Plots

> A close relative to bar plots
> 

Use case:

- You have a categorical variable
- You want to display numeric scores for each category on a log scale, or
- You want to display multiple numeric scores for each category.

Dot plots work in the same situations as bar plots, but have two advantages.

- We can use logarithmic scale with them
- We can plot multiple metrics with them

# **Interpreting dot plots**

Dot plots are similar to bar plots in that they show a numeric metric for each category of a categorical variable. They have two advantages over bar plots: you can use a log scale for the metric, and you can display more than one metric per category.

In the above dot plot, Scale is linear, and we can see that each point lies where the top of the bar would have been.
